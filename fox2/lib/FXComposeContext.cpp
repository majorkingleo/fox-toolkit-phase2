/*
  Notes:
  - In Asian languages, a text entry widget that's being edited may have
    an input method editor.  During the composition process, the system
    needs to keep track of the state of the composition until it is
    committed as an input to the widget.  This class represents that
    state.
  - Each text entry widget may have a compositon context, while it
    has the focus.
  - The composition context is deleted when the focus is moved to another
    widget away from the entry widget.
